1)
django by defAault looks in every app(ie he looks in blog app,users app) for static files(same for templates)
but convention must be app(blog)->static->blog(to put static files)->main.css
amd we dont need to add STATICFILES_PATH in projects setting
only add STATIC_URL = '/ststic/'

So to access the blog/main.css ,since it is in app(blog)->static->blog(to put static files)->main.css dir we only need to use
{%load static%}
href="{% static 'blog/main.css' %}"


2)if we wil make a static file in project root dir(ie along with apps and manage.py) then we need to add 
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')   //gives path of static file along with apps and manage.py
]
add up line in settings.py of project to tell django to look here also for static files bcs by default he looks only in apps static files
so using STATICFILES_DIRS it will look at both places

and if we if we have made a static file along with manage.py ie in projects root dir as it is in case 2 and we want to say to collect
static files from both places and keep in another file  so we also need to run 
an extra command python manage.py collectstatic and it will create a seprate folder to put all static file in called assets(can named anything) 
and to make folder assets we must include STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'assets') in setting
